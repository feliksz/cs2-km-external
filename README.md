# Counter-Strike 2 External

### Features:
- Player ESP
- Rank Reveal
- Spectator list

I started this project on November 2023, abandoned in May 2024 because of state of Counter-Strike 2 (game is literally unplayable, filled with rage hackers), also I didn't even try to make this project clean, I just wanted it to work, and it did.

Probably filled with shitton of redundant code, definitely schema manager code is outdated because of CS2 updates from spring which did changed structs related to SchemaManager.
